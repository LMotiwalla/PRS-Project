https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Anthony_Rocha html, Anthony V Rocha ,I had been a patient of Dr Rocha for a few years and while my health held up he was an okay doctor With my yearly visits I would imagine I was an easy payday for him  as a young and fairly active and healthy person there wasn't much he had to do The standard appointment consisted of a urine test some blood work and a quick 3 minute consultation in which he would continually warn me about the fluid in my legs and inquire about a thyroid issue that I had not had for quite a few years  Guess he did not care to read my chart prior to the consultation   However I contracted a viral chest infection that left me with no sense of smell taste and experiencing a variation of neurological symptoms After a load of tests run  specified and directed by me he did not even offer this  nothing was conclusive I was only referred to a couple of specialists at MY request and was sent away with pills anti depressants and Jesus pamphlets and told that this was just my new condition No other direction other than I simply had to adapt This is the care you get at Dr Rocha's As for the rest of the practice the phlebotomist has the social skills of a flea The receptionists are polite enough but look bored and bothered most of the time especially when you approach the desk upon arrival/departure Also good luck if you are trying to reach the office by phone  NO ONE picks up the phone I have been trying to call all week to have my medical records forwarded to my new GP and no one has picked up I have even attempted to reach the emergency help desk for information and was hung up on as well God help you if you are seriously ill and require immediate care  you will not get it at this place Given the shortage in GP's they know they can abuse their patients as there are little options to go to other practices given long waits insurance coverage etc They are laughing all the way to the bank and cashing in on the misery of their patients Once upon a time this place was a decent practice I initially went there as my parents were patients and he was a good doctor But it seems time and aging has made Dr Rocha lethargic and lazy as well as his team who are evidentially following his lead A doctor's work and learning is continual  a doctor should be curious and investigative so he may better serve his patients  a doctor should offer answers and/or options not shrugs ,1,-0.7978,1.4044

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Doctor fixated on Lyme disease and seems to have no appreciation that the excessive prescribing of antibiotics can result in many of the symptoms she will diagnose The doctor seems to have a true inability to engage in a dialogue and will often jump into long monologues on Lyme disease using tupperware models she has place around her office as props It seems she goes on auto pilot When asked a question her typical response is that's up to you I can't tell you what to do You signed a form  The form she is referring to is a from she has written and asks patients to sign in an attempt to absolve her for liability associated seeing every one who walks through her office doors as a Lyme disease patient Wait time in waiting room and examining room intolerable Staff and the doctor are very unorganized Office staff the doctor herself the office waiting & examining rooms all have an unkept appearance I am wary of web reviews myself but felt compelled to share my experience This doctor and her practice should be under very serious Board scrutiny Her practice is a disaster waiting to happen ,1,-0.4478,2.1044
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,After seeing over 20 doctors with over 10 inaccurate diagnosis all based on tests  I discovered Dr Carol Savage as an LLMD She accepted me as a new patient I was very pleased as many other LLMDs in the area are not accepting or may have over a 6 month wait Dr Carol Savage is very intelligent and stays very current with tic borne diseases and treatments She continually updates her knowledge and keeps her patients well informed of new treatments She recognizes that tic borne diseases can be very difficult to diagnose She does not 'treat to the test' but listens and carefully goes over your medical symptom logs and tests to ensure her best clinical diagnosis before prescribing any treatment Like all doc offices Dr Savage's office can have an extended wait But all her staff will listen display great care and will ensure you understand your treatment and why Her office manager went above and beyond to ensure my insurance would be accepted Her nurses and secretary have always taken the time to 'chat' and get to know me not the typical 'cattle treatment' like in neighboring large medical institutions My visits have always been pleasant and the staff takes the time to get to know you In all honesty my quality of life has been saved by Dr Savage and her staff As her patient for the past 2 years she has given me my life back ,3,0.993,4.986
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Carol_Savage html, Carol S Savage ,Dr Savage does not let anyone leave her office until all their questions have been answered which means she spends much more time with you than any other doctor I have been to I highly recommend her skill at diagnosing what ails you Dr Savage successfully treated me when no other doctor could figure out what was wrong with me and that is why I travel over one hour to get to her office Yes you may have to wait 30 minutes in her office before being seen but to me it is well worth the wait knowing that she will more than make up for that when she sees me Her staff are also extremely helpful making sure you don't leave their office until you fully understand what you need in regards to prescriptions tests and follow up appointments I highly recommend Dr Savage and her staff to anyone who needs a doctor who will listen to them and actually hear what their needs are This is no in and out quick fix office who need a computer next to them to figure out who you are Dr Savage and her staff know their patients by name when you walk through their door without looking at a computer screen This type of practice is rare but does give the patient confidence that they are being treated correctly I highly recommend this practice ,5,0.898,4.796

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I have had Dr Baraga as my primary care Dr for 5 years I never saw him with a severe medical issue To put it mildly Dr Baraga failed me I will never see him again or refer anyone to him for the way I was terated I went to Dartmouth medical center with severe left calf swelling and moderate pain He suggested a full blood and urine profile I agreed That test came back 100 perfect Next my leg was still swollen and getting worse The pain was umbearable I called Dartmouth for pain relief They said you need an ultrasound this was Saturday I went to Elliott hospital emergency   Got an Ultrasound  No blood clots I went back to Dartmouth Monday saw another Dr In Family practice at Dartmouth He could not figure out was was wrong either He ordered another ultrasound found I had a 6 x1 bakers cist that popped and leaked it's bad fluid into my calf He gave me steroids and non narcotic pain medication I went home took my pills and the swelling went down for the 5 days I had treatment for The day I ran out of medications my leg swelled up and the pain was severe now I called Dr Baraga at Dartmouth for continued treatment they refused I spent another week on the couch because the pain was too great to do anything The next week while still nursing the left leg my right calf blew up swollen like the right leg I made another appointment with Dr Baraga for the right leg He saw me and said you have another problem we need cat scan your heart or liver is probally the problem I pleaded with him that I believed I had another Bakers cist in the right leg He said you want me to believe you have 2 Bakers cists and they both popped about the same time Let me tell you something I have nerver saw a bakers cist in my whole career never mind 2 of them He reluctently sent me to ultrasound It was true I had 2 I was in severe pain unable to walk He did not even ask me how the pain was He gave me water pills for a week This treatment did nothing at all I knew I was going to be in pain for 2 weeks I was not able to walk I called Dartmouth to tell Dr Baraga of my problem He did not care to even call me back I called again the next day still in severe pain I found that taking 4 alleve every 4 hours this would kwell the pain but I was concerned about my stomache I called again he would not give me any pain medication just alltram which I had previously which did not help at all Dr Baraga is the worst Dr I ever have seen to date He has no empathy He doesn't care about his patients and is very arrogant I will never see him again ,1,-0.9918,1.0164
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Christopher_Braga html, Christopher C Braga ,I have been experiencing intestinal fatigue gas bloating anxiety and depression for a number of years so I decided to get some blood work done After reviewing my blood work he informed me that everything was okay I started asking him follow up questions at one point attempting to pronounce the name of the microbe that Lyme Disease is named after in hopes that he could confirm it for me He did not take well to this He thought I was trying to educate him and proceeded to role his eyes at me and say  Yeah I know what it is  Sorry doc Didn't mean to insult your ego The rest of the appointment took a downturn as he proceeded to interrupt me at every turn Apparently he is only a nice guy when you don't question his treatment methods He then recommended having me take a CT Scan He didn't bother to inform me of the risks involved with exposure to ionizing radiation After I began informing him of the risks  which is his job  he insisted that I can get the same level of radiation from stepping outside Quackery This doctor doesn't even know the difference between ionizing and non ionizing radiation Do your own research and you will find that CT scans can deliver up to 500 TIMES the ionizing radiation of a chest x ray and should only be used when the benefits out way the risks After informing him that I prefer less invasive and more natural methods of healing he told me that I was wasting my money and that alternative healthcare is a sham despite the fact that naturopathic doctors attend 4 years of medical school the first two being identical to conventional medicine In other words if the treatment doesn't involved a for profit patented synthetic prescription drug  with numerous side effects  then it cannot possibly work This doctor is arrogant He is a professional pill pusher much like many other conventional medical doctors He treats symptoms not underlying problems and will not inform you of the risks It is a shame that he is so quick to throw pills at people without at least considering less invasive methods of treatment such as changes in diet etc Yet his arrogance is merely a bi product of the sick care industry There is a reason why the USA has the HIGHEST  #1  instances of degenerative disease Be your own best advocate if you are going to see any conventional medical doctor And if you do this is not the doctor for you He will not take kindly to being questioned or having his profession/credentials evaluated ,1,-0.7476,1.5048

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,As I have stated in my previous review about Dr Jay Lorah I really loved him as my doctor He is fair honest and nice The only issue that I have is that I desperately needed a refill of medication that I have been on 10+ years It is the type of medication where if you stop it it is NOT good It causes HIGH blood pressure  which mine was 150/102 from the withdrawl effect  In an emergency my husband called a physician that he recently started to see to see if they could fit me in so I could get this refill since after three weeks of leaving messages plus a fax today Dr Lorah would not call in the script so I can get by for a month to find a new doctor I am so disappointed that he could not have anyone from his new office call me to tell me that he won't call in the Rx or tell me why he won't No communication at all I even sent a direct fax to the new practice begging for him to call in one last Rx NOTHING Dr Lorah I really liked and respected you but you definitely let me down so much the past three weeks I wish you could have just told me that you could not do it or something I got nothing I did not know you moved at all You were my favorite doctor All I wanted was one month to find a new doctor in my area You know that this drug has horrible withdraw effects that included high blood pressure I am very fortunate that my husband's doctor was able to squeeze me in today I could have been in the ER tonight Now I am feeling so much better after getting my Rx filled I understand that things happen in everyone's life but even my new doctor is shocked that you could not even just call me to tell me that you won't refill my script I wish you all of the happiness in the world I know you had a premature baby in the NICU I have two babies in the NICU myself so it is tough and scary Your former patients needed you and feel very abandoned That is not good business ,3,0.8774,4.7548

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Jay_Lorah html, Jay A Lorah ,I know former patients are upset angry and disappointed but please try to be fair Stuff happens and it appears that Dr Lorah got caught up in a really bad stuff storm I found out quite by accident and was a little taken aback But to say he is a bad doctor who didn't care about his patients is patently unfair and untrue One of the best memories my husband had during the last months of his life  was the time he spent talking with Dr Lorah about life style philosophy He had been a patient for a very short time and was under the direct care of an oncologist but Dr Lorah was always there I was a patient long before my husband was and even though at times I found the office staff exasperating Dr Lorah was ALWAYS available For a comment to be made about his children driving him crazy is irrelevant unkind and untrue Haters love to hate anything they don't understand and for a Dr to put his love of family and a simpler way of life before his professional gains is difficult for many people to wrap their minds around Many of us will miss him but life goes on and I wish him  Mrs Lorah and all the kids nothing but good things ,5,-0.9754,1.0492

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,I have been going to South County Hospital for 3 years now My primary care doctor is FANTASTIC He's super informative and takes the time to personally follow up with me versus having a random nurse call However this past week I started experiencing symptoms that were consistent with a UTI Any woman who has ever had one know that the main symptom is stinging when urinating I called in to make a same day appointment and was informed that my primary care doctor was on vacation and I could be seen by Dr Henseler After the unnecessary 30 minute wait  I was the ONLY one in the waiting room  i was brought in by the nurse who went through the motions of taking all of my vitals and asking why I was in to see the doctor so j told her everything She warned me that Dr Henseler likes to take her sweet time so to speed things up for me she had me do the urine sample early on I waited another 15 20 minutes before Dr Henseler decided to come see me and the very first thing that she asks is so why are you in today What symptoms have you been experiencing and I thought to myself  after making me wait all of this time couldn't you have had the courtesy to read the nurses notes and have some idea of what's going on with me  So I begin to explain  all over again  that what I have been experiencing is consistent with a UTI and before I could finish I was interrupted and in the most condescending voice I have ever heard she says to me again what are the SYMPTOMS you are having so I broke everything down for her from start to finish Then she tells me that my urine sample came back negative for any infection so I ask what else it could be and so she asks if I am sexually active  which normally I am but hadn't been since the symptoms started I have been with the same person for 5 years and we still get checked every year  after I tell her yes but not recently she blurts out CHLAMYDIA now you can imagine the shock I was unable to hide from my face She starts to elaborate and say a lot of the symptoms you have expressed leads me to believe it could be Chlamydia so naturally I explain how it is highly unlikely and ask what else it could be which seemed to annoy her so she begins suggesting that I have a small urethra so I ask if it is something that develops later in life and she explains that I would have been that way all my life and I begin to question her saying well if I had that would it sting every time I went pee my whole life and she began to fumble her words and say the only way to really determine what it is would be to do a pelvic exam at this point I've been insulted mislead misdiagnosed and have had my time completely wasted so I declined Also questioning whether she is even qualifies to perform pelvic exams on a whim  my understanding is that is what gynecologists are for  so at the end of everything I explain again I came in because I believed I had a serious infection and know that I am in pain so I was hoping to get some sort of antibiotic to flush my system and properly take care of my infection but you're telling me you don't think there is anything wrong with me and therefore you will not research further or prescribe me anything for the pain  Her response was a shrug of the shoulders and it really could be chlamydia but we will never know unless you have a pelvic exam in the mean time I can refer you to a urinologist in summary Dr Henseler took 2 hours of my time to leave me more worried and confused than when I walked in the door Needless to say I'm writing this from the emergency room where they chose to research further by taking blood samples x days and ultr sounds and I have unfortunately have gallbladder stones Dr Henseler simply did not WANT to help me so she didn't I have NEVER encountered such an apathetic doctor in my adult life I will NEVER see her again under ANY circumstances I'm writing this review as someone who genuinely cares about other people please save your frustration and time and DO NOT see Dr Henseler I'm afraid you will leave highly disappointed ,4,-0.986,1.028
https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Laura_Henseler html, Laura J Henseler ,Bluntly put I am seeking another primary care physician I began going to Dr Henseler back in 2012 Some of my visits with her were overall OK but most were I feel just simply because she wanted my co payment and to be able to bill my insurance company for an unnecessary visit I have been on the same medication now since 2001 for anxiety It is something that I will likely need to take for the rest of my life Well Dr Henseler wanted to adjust my dosage which was determined to be a mistake so she agreed after attempting to adjust my dosage that I just need to stay on the 20mg per day Well EVERY SINGLE TIME I have needed Dr authorization to refill this prescription WITHOUT FAIL her nurse will tell me that Dr Henseler will NOT refill it for me unless I make an appointment to see her WHAT Why in the world does she need to see me first It's already been determined I'm on the correct dosage Or her so called nurse who is definitely not the most efficient person for SURE has dropped the ball with my prescription by sending it to the WRONG pharmacy on more than one occasion will say the she will refill the medication FOR NOW but within 30 days I need to see Dr Henseler This to me is ridiculous and perhaps even bordering on unethical When I do see her she walks in the room without having a clue as to why I am there and will ask me why I'm here Seriously Don't you read my chart Don't you make notes Anyway I'm getting a little tired of doing this dance with her and I'm done Let somebody else help to put her kids through college and Catholic Schools I DO NOT RECOMMEND this doctor AT ALL ,1,0.2288,3.4576

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Margaret_Shelly html, Margaret E Shelly ,I normally don't write reviews but thought my experience with Dr Shelly required it I had been a patient of Dr Shelley for about 2 years I didn't have any problems with her until I needed more medical attention than a PCP could provide When I needed an emergency appointment for a kidney stone  it was misdiagnosed as a urinary infection but that's a common misdiagnosis  she had just gone on vacation There is supposed to be a backup doctor for such instances but she does not have one I then had to go to a health clinic who sent me to the ER What followed were a number of doctor visits The first few were out of my network  due to the emergency  and I needed backdated referals  this was a nightmare to get I was first told that all I needed were the doctor's ID number but then she wanted me to have the doctors call her  not common  On top of that she doesn't have a regular receptionist to answer phone calls or figure out problems and Doctor Shelly is not the easiest of people to talk to when there's a problem outside of medicine In addition to that when she got back from vacation I was told I needed to go back to a network doctor she sent me to a kidney stone specialist rather than a urologist further delaying my needed surgery by another week Bottom line if you have Dr Shelly as a PCP opt for the PPO plan rather than the HMO plan ,2,-0.8206,1.3588

https://www vitals com/doctors/Dr_Marisa_Bochman html, Marisa M Bochman ,When I first started seeing Dr Bochman several years ago I was extremely impressed with her caring and patient demeanor Most recently however over the past 3 5 appointments she has been rude condescending impatient and invalidating For example during my last appointment she negated and undermined all of my complaints blatantly failing to take the time to listen She told me that I didn't appear to be suffering or in pain  I was in tears  Despite spending a total of about 10 minutes with me she coded the visit as Level 4 She couldn't be bothered to follow up with me I should also note that if I hadn't spoken up to one of nurses and had followed her previous treatment as prescribed I very likely would've died due to a fatal drug drug interaction she carelessly overlooked Thanks to my medical background I am able to advocate for myself but I truly fear for the the life of the average patient/consumer with little or no medical knowledge It saddens me to see how her level of compassion and competence as a physician has declined so notably After my last appointment I left in tears vowing to find a new Primary Care Provider immediately I absolutely could *NOT* in good conscience recommend this physician ,1,-0.2816,2.4368
